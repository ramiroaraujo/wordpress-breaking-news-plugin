## Breaking News Wordpress Plugin

### Task:

Create a demo plugin that augments the Post's editing and modifies frontend content.

#### Admin/Backend:

The plugin needs to add a checkbox into the WordPress "Post" edit page. When the post is saved, the checkbox value should be saved in the post metadata.

#### Public/Frontend:

When displaying a post (both as a standalone page or within a listing) if the post has the "breaking news" value on, it should prefix the title with "Breaking:"

```<Title> -----------> Breaking: <Title>```
